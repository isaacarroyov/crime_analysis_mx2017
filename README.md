# Analysis of crimes in Mexico during 2017 with Machine Learning techniques (Cluster Analysis): Comparison Elbow Method and Silhouette Method
_Camacho-Perez Enrique, Arroyo-Vel√°zquez Isaac_

## Description
During the elective course of "Data Science" taught by Prof. Enrique Camacho in the Faculty of Engineering UADY, we performed a task to understand and practice an unsupervised learning algorithm and the selection of optimal number of clusters with the help of the Elbow Method. In this repository we go a little deeper than usual in class and compare it against another algorithm for selecting the optimal number of clusters called the Silhouette Method.


## Software Requirements:
* Python + 3.7
* The following libraries:
  * NumPy: `pip install numpy`
  * Pandas: `pip install pandas`
  * Sci-kit Learn: `pip install scikit-learn`
  * Folium: `pip install folium`
  * Seaborn: `pip install seaborn`
